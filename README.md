## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this challenge I learned how to use custom css properties more in depth and explore using the grid system. I was able to separate the image and text using CSS and improved my development skills in this area. 

### Continued development

I want to continue to advance my knowledge and skills as a developer. I am glad this was able to reinforce my CSS skills and I want to continue to improve and learn new ways of styling. I hope to keep developing in a way that makes me happy and keeps every experience fresh.
